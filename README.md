# Grade 11 Computer Science Project

This was a final project done in Grade 11 in 2006, before I went to Carleton University for my first degree in 2009. I was supposed to do this project with a partner however, due to health reasons, I rarely attended class. Therfore, I partnered with a paid tutor. This project was inspired by the minefield level in the Commadore 64 video Game "Beach Head". Since I wasn't attending class, I ensured the final project was impressive.
