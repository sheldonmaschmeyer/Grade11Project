# Grade 11 Computer Science Project

This was a final project done in Grade 11 in 2006, before I went to Carleton University for my first degree in 2009; computer science in 2015. I was supposed to do this project with a partner however, due to health reasons, I rarely attended class. Therefore, I partnered with a paid tutor. This project was inspired by the minefield level in the Commodore 64 video Game "Beach Head". Since I wasn't attending class, I ensured the final project was impressive. 

The final project was written in JAVA using the Eclipse IDE. The ship rotates and moves; fires torpeados at the enemy while evading mines (has the torpedo animation due to time constraints) and disruptor fire from the moving enemy.
